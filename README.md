# Zendesk Intenship Coding Challenge - Ticket Viewer

This is an application built with Ruby on Rails that accesses the Zendesk Api and display all tickets that are available.


## Mission Statement

This is my attempt at a solution for Zendesk Internship Coding Cahllenge. I decided to use Ruby on Rails as my framework as it was not only the framework that I'm most familair with, but also I thought that it would be a framework that would require the least amount fo steps to get the project up and going for assessment. 

## Assumptions

I am assuming that the person testing this will have `ruby` and `rails` already installed.

If not these are some steps you can do to to get this up amd running

### Ruby

```
$ brew install ruby
```

### Rails

```
$ gem install rails
```
