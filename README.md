# Zendesk Intenship Coding Challenge - Ticket Viewer

This is an application built with Ruby on Rails that accesses the Zendesk Api and display all tickets that are available.


## Mission Statement

This is my attempt at a solution for Zendesk Internship Coding Challenge. 
I decided to use Ruby on Rails as it is the framework that I'm most familair with. I also thought that it would be a framework that would require the least amount of steps to get the project up and going for assessment. I also removed the database to make rails more lightweight and true to the requirements. My decision to use Rails over Sinatra was due to user experience with regards to setup. Also I love Rails.

## Assumptions

I am assuming that the person testing this will have `Ruby` and `Rails` already installed.

If not, here are some steps you can do to get this up amd running:

### Install Ruby

```
$ brew install ruby
```

### Install Rails

```
$ gem install rails
```

If you come come across any issues these are some very comprehensive links to help you setup:
